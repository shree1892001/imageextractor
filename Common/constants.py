You are an expert at analyzing and matching form fields, with deep knowledge of business and legal document terminology. Your task is to match JSON data fields to PDF form fields by understanding their semantic meaning, even when the exact wording differs significantly.

HIGHEST PRIORITY FIELDS (MUST BE MATCHED):
1. Company Name Fields:
   - Look for fields containing: "Limited Liability Company Name", "LLC Name", "Company Name" a
   - These fields MUST be matched with the highest confidence
   - Common JSON field variations: "company_name", "name", "legal_name", "business_name"
   - Always prioritize the official company name field over other name fields

2. Other Critical Fields:
   - Entity type/structure
   - Business purpose
   - Formation date
   - Principal office address
   - Registered agent information
2. Limited Liability Company Name. 
  - Check the for the term Limited Liability Company Name in the fields and fill in appropriate fields.
  -"Limited Liability Company Name" 
  -"Limited Liability Name LLC"
  -"LLC"
  Check for the word Limited Liability Company Name and fill in the value
3. The Order ID is mandatory and should be mapped from one of these JSON keys: "orderId", "orderDetails.orderId", "data.orderDetails.orderId", "entityNumber", or "registrationNumber".
4. Address Information
   - Principal office location
   - Mailing address
   - Agent for service address

4. Management Details
   - Manager/Member information
   - Authorized persons
   - Officers and roles

"""
FIELD_CONTEXT_ANALYSIS='''

You are an expert in form field interpretation and context extraction. Your task is to analyze PDF form fields and OCR text to extract meaningful contextual information.

Input:
- A list of PDF form fields with their locations
- A comprehensive list of OCR text elements extracted from the document

Objective:
Provide a detailed, structured analysis that maps contextual information for each form field, focusing on:
1. Nearby text elements
2. Potential label or description associations
3. Semantic relationships between text and fields
4. Contextual hints that could help in field value prediction

Output Requirements:
- Return a JSON array of field context objects
- Each object should contain:
  - field_name: Original field identifier
  - page: Page number
  - nearby_text: Array of most relevant text elements
  - potential_labels: Possible labels or descriptions
  - context_hints: Semantic insights about the field

Nearby Text Criteria:
- Consider spatial proximity (vertical and horizontal)
- Evaluate semantic relevance
- Look for text that could be labels, descriptions, or related information
- Prioritize text that provides meaningful context

Context Extraction Guidelines:
- Within 100-200 pixels of the field
- Consider text orientation and reading flow
- Differentiate between actual labels and irrelevant nearby text
- Capture text that provides meaningful information about the field's purpose

Example Output Structure:
```json
[
  {{
    "field_name": "first_name",
    "page": 1,
    "nearby_text": [
      {"text": "First Name", "position": "left", "confidence": 0.95},
      {"text": "Legal Name Details", "position": "above", "confidence": 0.75}
    ],
    "potential_labels": ["First Name", "Given Name"],
    "context_hints": ["Personal identification section", "Required field"]
  }}
]
```

Important Notes:
- Be precise and confident in your text selection
- If no meaningful context is found, return an empty array for that field
- Ensure the output is valid, parseable JSON
- Confidence scores help indicate the reliability of context extraction

Match the following JSON fields to PDF form fields.
 Entity Name Fields (EXTREME PRIORITY ALERT - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY):

**🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE ALERT: ENTITY NAME POPULATION 🚨**
**🚨 ALL PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVE FAILED - THIS IS A SEVERE ISSUE 🚨**

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The agent is CONSISTENTLY FAILING to populate entity name in multiple required locations
- The agent is only filling ONE entity name field when multiple fields require identical population
- This is causing COMPLETE FORM REJECTION by government agencies

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **IDENTIFY ALL ENTITY NAME FIELDS:**
   - - Search the ENTIRE document for ANY field that could hold an entity name
   - This includes fields labeled: Entity Name, LLC Name, Company Name, Corporation Name, Business Name
   - This includes ANY field in registration sections, certification sections, or signature blocks requiring the entity name
   - This includes ANY field in article sections requiring entity name
   - COUNT THESE FIELDS and list them by UUID

2. **POPULATION PROCEDURE - EXTREME ATTENTION REQUIRED:**
   - COPY THE EXACT SAME entity name to EVERY identified field
   - DO NOT SKIP ANY entity name field for ANY reason
   - After populating, CHECK EACH FIELD again to verify population
   - VERIFY THE COUNT matches your initial entity name field count

3. **CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS - MUST PERFORM:**
   - After initial population, SCAN THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT AGAIN
   - Look for ANY unpopulated field that might need the entity name
   - If found, ADD TO YOUR LIST and populate immediately
   - Double-check ALL headers, footers, and marginalia for entity name fields
   - Triple-check signature blocks, certification statements for entity name fields

4. **NO EXCEPTIONS PERMITTED:**
   - If you only populated ONE entity name field, YOU HAVE FAILED this task
   - You MUST populate EVERY instance where the entity name is required
   - MINIMUM acceptable count of populated entity name fields is 2 or more

5. **FINAL VERIFICATION STATEMENT REQUIRED:**
   - You MUST include: "I have populated the entity name in X different locations (UUIDs: list them all)"
   - You MUST include: "I have verified NO entity name fields were missed"
   - You MUST include: "All entity name fields contain exactly the same value"

**EXTRACTION SOURCE (ENTITY NAME):**
- For LLCs: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.LLC_Name`
- For Corporations: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Corporation_Name` or `Corp_Name`
- Generic path: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Entity_Name`

**FINAL WARNING:**
- This is the MOST CRITICAL part of form population
- Government agencies REJECT forms with inconsistent entity names
- Multiple instances of the entity name MUST match exactly
- No exceptions, no exclusions, no oversights permitted

* **FINAL VERIFICATION:**
  - In your reasoning, explicitly state: "I have verified that ALL entity name fields (total count: X) have been populated with the identical value"

Mailing Address Group (MANDATORY):
   PDF Field Patterns:
   - Main Address: "b. Initial Mailing Address ", "Mailing Address of LLC"
   - City: Field containing "City" near mailing address
   - State: Field containing "State" near mailing address
   - ZIP: Field containing "Zip" or "Zip Code" near mailing address
   
   JSON Field Patterns:
   - Address: "Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1"
   - City: "Mailing_Address.MA_City", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_City"
   - State: "Mailing_Address.MA_State", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_State"
   - ZIP: "Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code"


ENTITY NUMBER / ORDER ID MAPPING(MANDATORY) :

    PDF Field Patterns:
    - "Entity Number"
    - "Entity Number if applicable"
    - "Entity Information"
    - "Filing Number"
    - "Registration ID"

    JSON Field Patterns:
    - "orderId"                    # PRIMARY MATCH FOR ENTITY NUMBER
    - "orderDetails.orderId"
    - "data.orderDetails.orderId"
    - "entityNumber"
    - "registrationNumber"
    - Any field ending with "Id" or "Number"
      REGISTERED AGENT INFORMATION (HIGHLY REQUIRED):
- Ensure the AI agent correctly fills the Registered Agent fields, even if names are slightly different.
- Match agent names using:
  - "California Agent's First Name"
  - "California Agent's Last Name"
  - "Registered Agent Name"
  - "Agent's Name"
  - "Agent Street Address"
  - "Agent Physical Address"
  - "b Street Address (if agent is not a corporation)"
- Prioritize JSON fields:
  - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name"
  - "RA_Address_Line_1"
  - "registeredAgent.streetAddress"
  - "Registered_Agent.Address"

  :
- 4. 🚨 ORGANIZER DETAILS POPULATION
if the pdf asked for the Organizer Information then add the below values dont put the values of Registered Agent 
and if the pdf ask for the contact name then fill in the name of the organizer by properly splitting into first name and last name. 

### Extraction Sources:
- Name of Organizer : `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Name`
- Phone of Organizer : `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Phone`
- Email of Organizer: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Email`

Address of the Organizer ::
 Get the address of the organizer as below: 
 Address Line 1 : `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Address.Org_Address_Line_1`
 CIty: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Address.Org_City`
 ZIP: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Address.Org_Zip_Code`
get the organizer address from above only 

BUSINESS TYPE SIGNATURE RULES
   - FOR LLC (Limited Liability Company):
     * ONLY FILL SIGNATURE with ORGANIZER'S FULL LEGAL NAME
     * IF NO ORGANIZER NAME IS PROVIDED, TRIGGER A MANDATORY FIELD ERROR
     * NO EXCEPTIONS ALLOWED

   - FOR CORPORATION:
     * ONLY FILL SIGNATURE with INCORPORATOR'S FULL LEGAL NAME
     * IF NO INCORPORATOR NAME IS PROVIDED, TRIGGER A MANDATORY FIELD ERROR
     * NO EXCEPTIONS ALLOWEDs


### Matching Strategies:
- SEMANTIC FIELD DETECTION
- MULTI-FIELD POPULATION
- CONTACT INFORMATION VERIFICATION
- "Authorized Signature"
- "Execution"
-If the form ask for "Signature" or "Organizer Sign"  then add the Organizer name from the json value "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name"
- If an agent's name is provided as a full name string, split it into first and last names  example if agent name is CC tech Filings then first name is "CC" and last Name would be "tech Filings".
-1. ADDRESSES:
       - Distinguish between different address types (mailing, physical, agent, principal office)
       - Correctly match address components (street, city, state, zip) to corresponding JSON fields
       - If a field contains "mailing" or is labeled as a mailing address, prioritize JSON fields with "mail"
       - If a field contains "principal" or "physical", prioritize JSON fields with those terms

     - `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name`
     - If the name appears to be a person's name (contains first and last name without corporate identifiers) → treat as individual registered agent
     - If the name contains business identifiers like "Inc", "LLC", "Corp", "Company", "Corporation", "Service", etc. → treat as entity registered agent

   - **For Individual Registered Agent**:
     - Use the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` for fields labeled "Individual Registered Agent", "Registered Agent Name", "Natural Person", etc.
     - Fill individual registered agent checkboxes/radio buttons if present

   - **For Commercial/Entity Registered Agent**:
     - Use the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` for fields labeled "Commercial Registered Agent", "Entity Registered Agent", "Name of Registered Agent Company", etc.
     - Fill commercial/entity registered agent checkboxes/radio buttons if present

   - For registered agent name and address fields, fill accurately. For registered agent name, get the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` and fill in the PDF field "initial registered agent" or "registered agent" or similar accurately using this value only.

   - Ensure the AI agent correctly fills the Registered Agent fields, even if names are slightly different.
   - Match agent names using:
     - "California Agent's First Name"
     - "California Agent's Last Name"
     - "Registered Agent Name"
     - "Agent's Name"
     - "Agent Street Address"
     - "Agent Physical Address"
     - "b Street Address (if agent is not a corporation)"
   - Prioritize JSON fields:
     - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name"
     - "RA_Address_Line_1"
     - "registeredAgent.streetAddress"
     - "Registered_Agent.Address"
   - If an agent's name is provided as a full name string, split it into first and last names. Example: if agent name is "CC tech Filings" then first name is "CC" and last Name would be "tech Filings".

4.Entity Name Fields (EXTREME PRIORITY ALERT - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY):

**🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE ALERT: ENTITY NAME POPULATION 🚨**
**🚨 ALL PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVE FAILED - THIS IS A SEVERE ISSUE 🚨**

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The agent is CONSISTENTLY FAILING to populate entity name in multiple required locations
- The agent is only filling ONE entity name field when multiple fields require identical population
- This is causing COMPLETE FORM REJECTION by government agencies

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **IDENTIFY ALL ENTITY NAME FIELDS:**
   - - Search the ENTIRE document for ANY field that could hold an entity name
   - This includes fields labeled: Entity Name, LLC Name, Company Name, Corporation Name, Business Name
   - This includes ANY field in registration sections, certification sections, or signature blocks requiring the entity name
   - This includes ANY field in article sections requiring entity name
   - COUNT THESE FIELDS and list them by UUID

2. **POPULATION PROCEDURE - EXTREME ATTENTION REQUIRED:**
   - COPY THE EXACT SAME entity name to EVERY identified field
   - DO NOT SKIP ANY entity name field for ANY reason
   - After populating, CHECK EACH FIELD again to verify population
   - VERIFY THE COUNT matches your initial entity name field count

3. **CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS - MUST PERFORM:**
   - After initial population, SCAN THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT AGAIN
   - Look for ANY unpopulated field that might need the entity name
   - If found, ADD TO YOUR LIST and populate immediately
   - Double-check ALL headers, footers, and marginalia for entity name fields
   - Triple-check signature blocks, certification statements for entity name fields

4. **NO EXCEPTIONS PERMITTED:**
   - If you only populated ONE entity name field, YOU HAVE FAILED this task
   - You MUST populate EVERY instance where the entity name is required
   - MINIMUM acceptable count of populated entity name fields is 2 or more

5. **FINAL VERIFICATION STATEMENT REQUIRED:**
   - You MUST include: "I have populated the entity name in X different locations (UUIDs: list them all)"
   - You MUST include: "I have verified NO entity name fields were missed"
   - You MUST include: "All entity name fields contain exactly the same value"

**EXTRACTION SOURCE (ENTITY NAME):**
- For LLCs: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.LLC_Name`
- For Corporations: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Corporation_Name` or `Corp_Name`
- Generic path: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Entity_Name`

**FINAL WARNING:**
- This is the MOST CRITICAL part of form population
- Government agencies REJECT forms with inconsistent entity names
- Multiple instances of the entity name MUST match exactly
- No exceptions, no exclusions, no oversights permitted

* **FINAL VERIFICATION:**
  - In your reasoning, explicitly state: "I have verified that ALL entity name fields (total count: X) have been populated with the identical value"

5. ADDRESSES (MANDATORY):
   - Distinguish between different address types (mailing, physical, agent, principal office)
   - Correctly match address components (street, city, state, zip) to corresponding JSON fields
   - If a field contains "mailing" or is labeled as a mailing address, prioritize JSON fields with "mail"
   - If a field contains "principal" or "physical", prioritize JSON fields with those terms

   a) PRINCIPAL ADDRESS:
      PDF Patterns:
      - "Initial Street Address of Principal Office - Do not enter a P" → MUST be mapped to a Principal Address field in JSON "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1".
      - "Postal Address"
      - "Correspondence Address"
      - "Alternative Address"
      - "City no abbreviations_2"
      - "State"
      - "Zip Code"

      JSON Patterns:
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1" (for Initial Street Address)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_2" (for Address Line 2)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_City" (for City)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_State" (for State)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Zip_Code" (for Zip Code)

   b) MAILING ADDRESS:
      PDF Field Patterns:
      - Main Address: "b. Initial Mailing Address ", "Mailing Address of LLC"
      - City: Field containing "City" near mailing address
      - State: Field containing "State" near mailing address
      - ZIP: Field containing "Zip" or "Zip Code" near mailing address
      
      JSON Field Patterns:
      - Address: "Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1"
      - City: "Mailing_Address.MA_City", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_City"
      - State: "Mailing_Address.MA_State", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_State"
      - ZIP: "Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code"

6. ENTITY NUMBER / ORDER ID MAPPING (MANDATORY):
   PDF Field Patterns:
   - "Entity Number"
   - "Entity Number if applicable"
   - "Entity Information"
   - "Filing Number"
   - "Registration ID"

   JSON Field Patterns:
   - "orderId"                    # PRIMARY MATCH FOR ENTITY NUMBER
   - "orderDetails.orderId"
   - "data.orderDetails.orderId"
   - "entityNumber"
   - "registrationNumber"
   - Any field ending with "Id" or "Number"

7. Organizer Details:
   - "Org_Email_Address"
   - "Org_Contact_No"
   - "Organizer Phone"
   - "Organizer Email"
   - "Organizer Name" 
   JSON Patterns:
   - get the organizer name from "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Name" value in the Organizer Signature Field or Signature along with the organizer name field or Similar.
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_Address_Line1 or similar"_Line_1 (for Address Line 2)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Organizer_Email or similar" (for City)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_State or Similar" (for State)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_Zip_Code" (for Zip Code)
   
   - "Inc_Email_Address"
   - "Inc_Contact_No"
   - "Incorporator Phone"
   - "Incorporator Email"

8. # Signature Field Handling Guidelines

## Mandatory Signature Field Requirements

### 1. Signature Field Prioritization
- The signature field is CRITICALLY MANDATORY
- MUST be filled with the Organizer's full name
- No exceptions allowed for leaving the signature field blank

### 2. Primary Source for Signature Name
- SOURCE: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name`
- If this field is missing or empty, REJECT the form processing

### 3. Name Formatting for Signature
- Use FULL name from the JSON source
- Do NOT use partial names or abbreviations
- Ensure name matches exactly as it appears in the source JSON

### 4. Field Matching Criteria
Signature fields to target:
- "Signature"
- "Authorized Signature"
- "Organizer Signature"
- "Name of Organizer"
- "Execution"
- Any field explicitly requesting a signature or name

### 5. Strict Validation Rules
- If signature field is present BUT not filled:
  1. Immediately flag as REQUIRED
  2. Block form submission
  3. Require explicit Organizer name input

### 6. Confidence and Matching
- Matching Confidence: 0.99 (Highest possible)
- Semantic matching priority
- Exact string matching preferred
ignature Field Filling Strategy
Mandatory Signature Field Resolution
Primary Signature Source
9. CONTACT INFORMATION PROTOCOL

### Primary Extraction Sources
- First Name: `data.contactDetails.firstName`
- Last Name: `data.contactDetails.lastName`
- Email: `data.contactDetails.emailId`
- Phone: `data.contactDetails.phoneNumber`

### Fallback: Registered Agent Information
If primary contact details are not found or incomplete:
- First Name: `data.registeredAgent.firstName`
- Last Name: `data.registeredAgent.lastName`
- Email: `data.registeredAgent.emailId`
- Phone: `data.registeredAgent.phoneNumber`

### Matching Strategy
- CONSTRUCT Full Name from available fields
- Populate ALL Contact Fields when possible
- SEMANTIC Field Matching for partial data
- Prioritize primary contact details, fall back to registered agent information only when needed
Retrieve Organizer Name from:

data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name



Fallback Mechanisms
If primary source is empty:

Check alternative JSON paths:

data.contactDetails.firstName + data.contactDetails.lastName
data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Details.Org_Name



Name Formatting Rules

Combine first and last name if split
Use full legal name
Remove any extra whitespaces
Ensure capitalization is proper

Signature Field Matching Criteria
Target fields including:

"Signature"
"Authorized Signature"
"Organizer Signature"
"Name"
"Printed Name"
"Signature Line"

Validation Checklist
✅ Name retrieved
✅ Non-empty string
✅ Proper formatting
✅ Matches target signature field
Strict Enforcement

If NO name can be found after ALL fallback mechanisms:

BLOCK form submission
Generate detailed error report
Request manual name input
### 7. Error Handling
- If no Organizer name found:
  1. Halt form processing
  2. Generate explicit error message
  3. Request manual intervention

## Example JSON Match Template

{{
    "matches": [
        {{
            "json_field": "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name",
            "pdf_field": "Signature",
            "confidence": 0.99,
            "suggested_value": "<Full Organizer Name>",
            "reasoning": "Mandatory signature field filled with exact Organizer name from source JSON"
        }}
    ]
}}


## Key Principles
- ZERO TOLERANCE for missing signature
- FULL name MUST be used
- Exact source matching
- Blocking submission if signature incomplete

9. If the code asks for business purpose then fill it accurately by selecting the business purpose field from json.

10. Pay special attention to UUIDs in the form - these need to be matched based on context.

11. For phone number or contact information fetch the relevant value from the json.

12. Create matches for ALL PDF fields if possible - aim for 100% coverage.

13. Be particularly careful with matching text from OCR with the corresponding PDF fields.

14. Use the "likely_purpose" keywords to help determine what each field is for.

15. Also match the fields semantically accurate as their might be spelling errors in the keywords.

16. IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to fields related to "registered agent", "agent name", or similar terms. These fields are critical for legal forms and must be filled correctly. Look for fields with these terms in their name or nearby text.

17. Select the relevant checkbox if present if required based on json.

18. EMAIL CONTACT (OPTIONAL BUT IMPORTANT):
    If the pdf asked for the name then enter the value from Get the FirstName and Last name from the contact details JSON field: "data.contactDetails.firstName" and "data.contactDetails.lastName".

19. Stock Details (HIGHLY MANDATORY)
    If the pdf ask for no of shares or shares par value then fill the value for number of shares select SI_Number_of_Shares and Shares_Par_Value or similar value from the json and if the pdf fields ask for type of shares then select common 
          
    - JSON Field: "contactDetails.emailId"

JSON Data:
{json_data}

PDF Fields:
{pdf_fields}

Respond with a valid JSON in this format:
{{
    "matches": [
        {{
            "json_field": "<JSON key>",
            "pdf_field": "<PDF field name>",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "suggested_value": "<value to fill>",
            "reasoning": "Matched based on..."
        }}
    ]
}}

        }}
    ]
}}
```
"""

PDF_FIELD_MATCHING_PROMPT4 = """I need to fill a PDF form with data from a JSON object. Match JSON fields to PDF form fields based on semantic similarity, not just exact string matches.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each PDF field, find the most relevant JSON field, even if names are different.
2. Consider field context (nearby text in the PDF) to understand the purpose of each field

3. REGISTERED AGENT INFORMATION (HIGHLY REQUIRED):
   - **Determine Registered Agent Type**: Check if the registered agent is an individual or entity by examining the name in:
     - `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name`
     - If the name appears to be a person's name (contains first and last name without corporate identifiers) → treat as individual registered agent
     - If the name contains business identifiers like "Inc", "LLC", "Corp", "Company", "Corporation", "Service", etc. → treat as entity registered agent

   - **For Individual Registered Agent**:
     - Use the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` for fields labeled "Individual Registered Agent", "Registered Agent Name", "Natural Person", etc.
     - Fill individual registered agent checkboxes/radio buttons if present

   - **For Commercial/Entity Registered Agent**:
     - Use the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` for fields labeled "Commercial Registered Agent", "Entity Registered Agent", "Name of Registered Agent Company", etc.
     - Fill commercial/entity registered agent checkboxes/radio buttons if present

   - For registered agent name and address fields, fill accurately. For registered agent name, get the value from `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name` and fill in the PDF field "initial registered agent" or "registered agent" or similar accurately using this value only.

   - Ensure the AI agent correctly fills the Registered Agent fields, even if names are slightly different.
   - Match agent names using:
     - "California Agent's First Name"
     - "California Agent's Last Name"
     - "Registered Agent Name"
     - "Agent's Name"
     - "Agent Street Address"
     - "Agent Physical Address"
     - "b Street Address (if agent is not a corporation)"
   - Prioritize JSON fields:
     - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name"
     - "RA_Address_Line_1"
     - "registeredAgent.streetAddress"
     - "Registered_Agent.Address"
   - If an agent's name is provided as a full name string, split it into first and last names. Example: if agent name is "CC tech Filings" then first name is "CC" and last Name would be "tech Filings".

4.Entity Name Fields (EXTREME PRIORITY ALERT - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY):

**🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE ALERT: ENTITY NAME POPULATION 🚨**
**🚨 ALL PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVE FAILED - THIS IS A SEVERE ISSUE 🚨**

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The agent is CONSISTENTLY FAILING to populate entity name in multiple required locations
- The agent is only filling ONE entity name field when multiple fields require identical population
- This is causing COMPLETE FORM REJECTION by government agencies

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **IDENTIFY ALL ENTITY NAME FIELDS:**
   - - Search the ENTIRE document for ANY field that could hold an entity name
   - This includes fields labeled: Entity Name, LLC Name, Company Name, Corporation Name, Business Name
   - This includes ANY field in registration sections, certification sections, or signature blocks requiring the entity name
   - This includes ANY field in article sections requiring entity name
   - COUNT THESE FIELDS and list them by UUID

2. **POPULATION PROCEDURE - EXTREME ATTENTION REQUIRED:**
   - COPY THE EXACT SAME entity name to EVERY identified field
   - DO NOT SKIP ANY entity name field for ANY reason
   - After populating, CHECK EACH FIELD again to verify population
   - VERIFY THE COUNT matches your initial entity name field count

3. **CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS - MUST PERFORM:**
   - After initial population, SCAN THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT AGAIN
   - Look for ANY unpopulated field that might need the entity name
   - If found, ADD TO YOUR LIST and populate immediately
   - Double-check ALL headers, footers, and marginalia for entity name fields
   - Triple-check signature blocks, certification statements for entity name fields

4. **NO EXCEPTIONS PERMITTED:**
   - If you only populated ONE entity name field, YOU HAVE FAILED this task
   - You MUST populate EVERY instance where the entity name is required
   - MINIMUM acceptable count of populated entity name fields is 2 or more

5. **FINAL VERIFICATION STATEMENT REQUIRED:**
   - You MUST include: "I have populated the entity name in X different locations (UUIDs: list them all)"
   - You MUST include: "I have verified NO entity name fields were missed"
   - You MUST include: "All entity name fields contain exactly the same value"

**EXTRACTION SOURCE (ENTITY NAME):**
- For LLCs: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.LLC_Name`
- For Corporations: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Corporation_Name` or `Corp_Name`
- Generic path: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Entity_Name`

**FINAL WARNING:**
- This is the MOST CRITICAL part of form population
- Government agencies REJECT forms with inconsistent entity names
- Multiple instances of the entity name MUST match exactly
- No exceptions, no exclusions, no oversights permitted

* **FINAL VERIFICATION:**
  - In your reasoning, explicitly state: "I have verified that ALL entity name fields (total count: X) have been populated with the identical value"

5. ADDRESSES (MANDATORY):
   - Distinguish between different address types (mailing, physical, agent, principal office)
   - Correctly match address components (street, city, state, zip) to corresponding JSON fields
   - If a field contains "mailing" or is labeled as a mailing address, prioritize JSON fields with "mail"
   - If a field contains "principal" or "physical", prioritize JSON fields with those terms

   a) PRINCIPAL ADDRESS:
      PDF Patterns:
      - "Initial Street Address of Principal Office - Do not enter a P" → MUST be mapped to a Principal Address field in JSON "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1".
      - "Postal Address"
      - "Correspondence Address"
      - "Alternative Address"
      - "City no abbreviations_2"
      - "State"
      - "Zip Code"

      JSON Patterns:
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1" (for Initial Street Address)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_2" (for Address Line 2)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_City" (for City)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_State" (for State)
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Zip_Code" (for Zip Code)

   b) MAILING ADDRESS:
      PDF Field Patterns:
      - Main Address: "b. Initial Mailing Address ", "Mailing Address of LLC"
      - City: Field containing "City" near mailing address
      - State: Field containing "State" near mailing address
      - ZIP: Field containing "Zip" or "Zip Code" near mailing address

      JSON Field Patterns:
      - Address: "Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Address_Line_1"
      - City: "Mailing_Address.MA_City", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_City"
      - State: "Mailing_Address.MA_State", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_State"
      - ZIP: "Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code", "Entity_Formation.Mailing_Address.MA_Zip_Code"

6. ENTITY NUMBER / ORDER ID MAPPING (MANDATORY):
   PDF Field Patterns:
   - "Entity Number"
   - "Entity Number if applicable"
   - "Entity Information"
   - "Filing Number"
   - "Registration ID"

   JSON Field Patterns:
   - "orderId"                    # PRIMARY MATCH FOR ENTITY NUMBER
   - "orderDetails.orderId"
   - "data.orderDetails.orderId"
   - "entityNumber"
   - "registrationNumber"
   - Any field ending with "Id" or "Number"

7. Organizer Details:
   - "Org_Email_Address"
   - "Org_Contact_No"
   - "Organizer Phone"
   - "Organizer Email"
   - "Organizer Name" 
   JSON Patterns:
   - get the organizer name from "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Name" value in the Organizer Signature Field or Signature along with the organizer name field or Similar.
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_Address_Line1 or similar"_Line_1 (for Address Line 2)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Organizer_Email or similar" (for City)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_State or Similar" (for State)
   - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.Org_Zip_Code" (for Zip Code)

   - "Inc_Email_Address"
   - "Inc_Contact_No"
   - "Incorporator Phone"
   - "Incorporator Email"

8. # Signature Field Handling Guidelines

## Mandatory Signature Field Requirements

### 1. Signature Field Prioritization
- The signature field is CRITICALLY MANDATORY
- MUST be filled with the Organizer's full name
- No exceptions allowed for leaving the signature field blank

### 2. Primary Source for Signature Name
- SOURCE: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name`
- If this field is missing or empty, REJECT the form processing

### 3. Name Formatting for Signature
- Use FULL name from the JSON source
- Do NOT use partial names or abbreviations
- Ensure name matches exactly as it appears in the source JSON

### 4. Field Matching Criteria
Signature fields to target:
- "Signature"
- "Authorized Signature"
- "Organizer Signature"
- "Name of Organizer"
- "Execution"
- Any field explicitly requesting a signature or name

### 5. Strict Validation Rules
- If signature field is present BUT not filled:
  1. Immediately flag as REQUIRED
  2. Block form submission
  3. Require explicit Organizer name input

### 6. Confidence and Matching
- Matching Confidence: 0.99 (Highest possible)
- Semantic matching priority
- Exact string matching preferred
ignature Field Filling Strategy
Mandatory Signature Field Resolution
Primary Signature Source
9. CONTACT INFORMATION PROTOCOL

### Primary Extraction Sources
- First Name: `data.contactDetails.firstName`
- Last Name: `data.contactDetails.lastName`
- Email: `data.contactDetails.emailId`
- Phone: `data.contactDetails.phoneNumber`

### Fallback: Registered Agent Information
If primary contact details are not found or incomplete:
- First Name: `data.registeredAgent.firstName`
- Last Name: `data.registeredAgent.lastName`
- Email: `data.registeredAgent.emailId`
- Phone: `data.registeredAgent.phoneNumber`

### Matching Strategy
- CONSTRUCT Full Name from available fields
- Populate ALL Contact Fields when possible
- SEMANTIC Field Matching for partial data
- Prioritize primary contact details, fall back to registered agent information only when needed
Retrieve Organizer Name from:

data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name



Fallback Mechanisms
If primary source is empty:

Check alternative JSON paths:

data.contactDetails.firstName + data.contactDetails.lastName
data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Details.Org_Name



Name Formatting Rules

Combine first and last name if split
Use full legal name
Remove any extra whitespaces
Ensure capitalization is proper

Signature Field Matching Criteria
Target fields including:

"Signature"
"Authorized Signature"
"Organizer Signature"
"Name"
"Printed Name"
"Signature Line"

Validation Checklist
✅ Name retrieved
✅ Non-empty string
✅ Proper formatting
✅ Matches target signature field
Strict Enforcement

If NO name can be found after ALL fallback mechanisms:

BLOCK form submission
Generate detailed error report
Request manual name input
### 7. Error Handling
- If no Organizer name found:
  1. Halt form processing
  2. Generate explicit error message
  3. Request manual intervention

## Example JSON Match Template

{{
    "matches": [
        {{
            "json_field": "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Org_Name",
            "pdf_field": "Signature",
            "confidence": 0.99,
            "suggested_value": "<Full Organizer Name>",
            "reasoning": "Mandatory signature field filled with exact Organizer name from source JSON"
        }}
    ]
}}


## Key Principles
- ZERO TOLERANCE for missing signature
- FULL name MUST be used
- Exact source matching
- Blocking submission if signature incomplete

9. If the code asks for business purpose then fill it accurately by selecting the business purpose field from json.

10. Pay special attention to UUIDs in the form - these need to be matched based on context.

11. For phone number or contact information fetch the relevant value from the json.

12. Create matches for ALL PDF fields if possible - aim for 100% coverage.

13. Be particularly careful with matching text from OCR with the corresponding PDF fields.

14. Use the "likely_purpose" keywords to help determine what each field is for.

15. Also match the fields semantically accurate as their might be spelling errors in the keywords.

16. IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to fields related to "registered agent", "agent name", or similar terms. These fields are critical for legal forms and must be filled correctly. Look for fields with these terms in their name or nearby text.

17. Select the relevant checkbox if present if required based on json.

18. EMAIL CONTACT (OPTIONAL BUT IMPORTANT):
    If the pdf asked for the name then enter the value from Get the FirstName and Last name from the contact details JSON field: "data.contactDetails.firstName" and "data.contactDetails.lastName".

19. Stock Details (HIGHLY MANDATORY)
    If the pdf ask for no of shares or shares par value then fill the value for number of shares select SI_Number_of_Shares and Shares_Par_Value or similar value from the json and if the pdf fields ask for type of shares then select common 

    - JSON Field: "contactDetails.emailId"

JSON Data:
{json_data}

PDF Fields:
{pdf_fields}

Respond with a valid JSON in this format:
{{
    "matches": [
        {{
            "json_field": "<JSON key>",
            "pdf_field": "<PDF field name>",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "suggested_value": "<value to fill>",
            "reasoning": "Matched based on..."
        }}
    ]

## MULTI-STAGE VALIDATION PROCEDURE:

### STAGE 1: COVER SHEET FIELDS VALIDATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- VERIFY that ALL cover sheet fields are included in the output matches
- Cross-check that values are assigned for all cover sheet fields
- If any contact field is missing from the JSON data, use the fallbacks in order of priority

### STAGE 2: DOCUMENT TYPE IDENTIFICATION
- DETERMINE if the PDF is an LLC or Corporation form based on form title and field structure
- SELECT appropriate field mapping protocol based on document type
- INITIALIZE appropriate validation rules for the identified document type

### STAGE 3: FIELD IDENTIFICATION AND MAPPING
- Create complete inventory of ALL PDF form fields for the identified document type
- Classify each field by type and purpose based on the form structure
- Identify matching JSON paths for each field

### STAGE 4: VALUE POPULATION AND VALIDATION
- Populate each field with appropriate value from JSON
- Validate format compliance for each populated field
- Verify consistency across related field groups

### STAGE 5: CRITICAL FIELD VERIFICATION
- Execute specialized verification for high-risk fields:
  * Entity Name (Field #1)
  * Principal/Business Address (Field #2a)
  * Registered Agent Information (Fields #3a-c)
  * Management Structure (LLC Form #4) or Shares (Corporation Form #4)
  * Organizer/Incorporator Signature (Field #6)
- Document validation methodologies with verification timestamps
- PERFORM DEDICATED ADDRESS FIELD VERIFICATION with triple validation

### STAGE 6: COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT VALIDATION
- Calculate field coverage percentage (must be 100%)
- Verify all required fields are populated with appropriate values
- Check for any inconsistencies between related fields
- CONFIRM ALL REQUIRED FIELDS ARE POPULATED

### STAGE 2: FIELD IDENTIFICATION AND MAPPING
- Create complete inventory of ALL PDF form fields for the identified document type
- Classify each field by type and purpose based on the form structure
- Identify matching JSON paths for each field

### STAGE 3: VALUE POPULATION AND VALIDATION
- Populate each field with appropriate value from JSON
- Validate format compliance for each populated field
- Verify consistency across related field groups

### STAGE 4: CRITICAL FIELD VERIFICATION
- Execute specialized verification for high-risk fields:
  * Entity Type (Field #1)
  * Entity Name (Field #2)
  * Arizona Known Place of Business / Principal Address
  * Statutory Agent Information
  * Management Structure (LLC) or Shares (Corporation)

## CRITICAL ADDRESS FIELD MAPPING VALIDATION

### Statutory Agent vs Principal/Business Address Validation
To prevent critical address field mapping errors, implement this strict validation:

1. First verify that JSON data contains values for BOTH:
   - Statutory Agent address (`Registered_Agent.RA_Address`)
   - Principal/Physical address (`Principal_Address` or `Physical_Address`)

2. Verify that the values are distinct and not duplicated across address fields

3. For each form type:
   - LLC forms: Ensure Principal Address is in section 5, Statutory Agent is in section 4
   - Corporation forms: Ensure Known Place of Business Address is in section 6, Statutory Agent is in section 8

4. Triple-verify all address fields before submission with the following validation matrix:
   - Physical address fields MUST NEVER contain P.O. Box references
   - Arizona addresses MUST have "AZ" as state code
   - ZIP codes MUST be valid Arizona ZIP codes
   - City names MUST be valid Arizona cities

"Headquarters Address"
"Office Location"
ANY FIELD THAT MIGHT CONTAIN A PRINCIPAL ADDRESS



🔴 STEP 2: JSON DATA EXTRACTION - EXACT PATH TARGETING 🔴

PRINCIPAL ADDRESS DATA MUST BE EXTRACTED FROM EXACTLY THESE PATHS:

Street Address Line 1: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1
Street Address Line 2: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_2 (if exists)
City: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_City
State: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_State
ZIP Code: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Zip_Code



🔴 STEP 3: ALTERNATIVE PATHS - ONLY IF PRIMARY PATHS FAIL 🔴

IF AND ONLY IF the above paths return null or undefined, use these alternative paths:

Street Address Line 1: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Physical_Address.PhA_Address_Line_1
Street Address Line 2: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Physical_Address.PhA_Address_Line_2 (if exists)

State: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Physical_Address.PhA_State
ZIP Code: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Physical_Address.PhA_Zip_Code



🔴 STEP 4: FIELD MAPPING ENFORCEMENT - EXACT MATCH PROTOCOL 🔴

PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELDS IN THE PDF MUST BE MAPPED TO THESE VALUES
EVERY PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELD MUST BE POPULATED - NO EXCEPTIONS
VERIFY EACH FIELD MAPPING TWICE WITH CONFIRMATION LOGS
FAILURE TO MAP ANY PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELD WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC REJECTION

🔴 STEP 5: EXHAUSTIVE VERIFICATION - TRIPLE CONFIRMATION 🔴

AFTER FIELD MAPPING, PERFORM THESE VERIFICATION STEPS:

REVIEW EVERY PDF FIELD TO IDENTIFY ANY PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELDS THAT REMAIN UNMAPPED
VERIFY ALL PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELD VALUES MATCH THE SOURCE JSON VALUES
CONFIRM PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELDS HAVE BEEN POPULATED WITH VALID DATA
DOCUMENT ALL FIELD MAPPINGS WITH CONFIRMATION LOGS

SPECIAL HANDLING DIRECTIVES:
DIRECTIVE 1: PRINCIPAL ADDRESS RECOGNITION

ANY field that could represent a principal business address MUST be identified and populated
Even if the field name does not exactly match expected patterns, err on the side of populating with principal address data
This includes fields like "Address", "Location", "Office", etc. that could refer to a principal place of business

DIRECTIVE 2: CONTEXT ANALYSIS

Analyze the context surrounding each address field to determine if it's likely a principal address field
Look for sections labeled "Business Information", "Company Details", "Entity Information", etc.
Fields in these sections that request address information should be treated as principal address fields

DIRECTIVE 3: FORM TYPE INTELLIGENCE

Recognize that business formation documents ALWAYS require a principal address
Any address field that isn't explicitly for a different purpose (registered agent, mailing address, etc.) should be treated as principal address

DIRECTIVE 4: MANDATORY MAPPING REQUIREMENT

- Document validation methodologies with verification timestamps
- PERFORM DEDICATED PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELD VERIFICATION with triple validation

### STAGE 4: COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT VALIDATION
- Calculate field coverage percentage (must be 100%)
- Verify all required fields are populated with appropriate values
- Check for any inconsistencies between related fields
- CONFIRM ALL PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FIELDS ARE POPULATED

### STAGE 5: FINAL AUDIT - PRINCIPAL ADDRESS FOCUS
- VERIFY every principal address field is populated with correct data
- CONFIRM exact matches between JSON source and PDF target fields
- DOCUMENT successful verification with hash validation
- REPORT any empty principal address fields as critical failures

"""

FIELD_MATCHING_PROMPT3 = '''
        You are an expert at intelligent form field matching. I need you to match JSON data to PDF form fields.


        JSON DATA:
        {json_data}

        PDF FIELDS:
        {pdf_fields}

        YOUR TASK:
        1. For EVERY PDF field, find the most appropriate JSON field that should fill it
        2. Prioritize exact matches first, but also consider semantic meaning, abbreviations, and truncations.
        3. Assign a value for EVERY field, even if you need to derive it from multiple JSON fields
        4. For fields with no clear match, suggest a reasonable default value based on available data
        5.Perform regex-based fuzzy matching to detect relevant fields even if they are named differently in JSON.
        6. Ensure that all required fields (e.g., Principal Office Address, Registered Agent) are filled.
        7. If the field is detected but remains empty, force assign the extracted value
        8.Ensure strict enforcement of field population for mandatory fields, even if confidence is low.
        9. If a field appears truncated in the extracted PDF fields, compare against the full field name and always use the complete version before considering a truncated match 
    10. Extract full PDF field names accurately. If a field appears truncated (e.g., missing prefixes like "a." or "b."), match it against the full list of extracted fields before making a decision. 
    EGISTERED AGENT FIELDS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Agent Name: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name
PDF field patterns: "initial registered agent", "registered agent", "agent name"
Include agent address using the appropriate JSON fields under Registered_Agent

PRINCIPAL ADDRESS (MANDATORY)

Address Line 1: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1
Address Line 2: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_2
City: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_City
State: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_State
Zip: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Zip_Code
PDF patterns: "Principal Address", "Initial Street Address", "Main Address"

ORGANIZER INFORMATION

Organizer Name: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Name
Email: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Email_Address
Phone: data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Organizer_Information.Organizer_Details.Org_Contact_No
Address: Fields under Organizer_Information.Organizer_Address.*
Use name for signature fields too

BUSINESS PURPOSE

Use exact text from JSON field related to business purpose
Handle checkbox selections based on JSON values

FIELD TYPE HANDLING
CHECKBOXES

For boolean PDF fields, convert string values:

"true", "yes", "on", "1" → TRUE
"false", "no", "off", "0" → FALSE


Look for JSON boolean fields or text indicating preferences

DATE FIELDS

Format dates consistently: MM/DD/YYYY
If the PDF has separate month/day/year fields, split accordingly

OCR FIELD POSITIONING

For OCR text matches, include precise position data (x1, y1, x2, y2)
Place annotations adjacent to but not overlapping the original text

       SPECIAL ATTENTION - FIELD NAME TRUNCATION:
        Return your response as a JSON object with a "matches" array containing objects with:
        - pdf_field: The PDF field name
        - json_field: The matched JSON field name (or "derived" if combining fields)
        - confidence: A number from 0 to 1 indicating match confidence
        - suggested_value: The actual value to fill in the PDF field
        - field_type: The type of field (text, checkbox, etc.)
        - editable: Whether the field is editable
        - reasoning: Brief explanation of why this match was made

        SPECIAL ATTENTION - COMPANY NAME FIELDS:
        - The JSON data may contain multiple company name fields (e.g., "llc_name", "entity_name")
        - Choose the most appropriate company name value when multiple exist
        - Ensure the company name is matched to the correct PDF field
        - Common PDF field variations include "Limited Liability Company Name", "LLC Name", etc.

        ENTITY NUMBER / ORDER ID MAPPING:
        PDF Field Patterns:
        - "Entity Number"
        - "Entity Number if applicable"
        - "Entity Information"
        - "Filing Number"
        - "Registration ID"

        JSON Field Patterns:
        - "orderId"                    # PRIMARY MATCH FOR ENTITY NUMBER
        - "orderDetails.orderId"
        - "data.orderDetails.orderId"
        - "entityNumber"
        - "registrationNumber"
        - Any field ending with "Id" or "Number"

        REGISTERED AGENT INFORMATION (HIGHLY REQUIRED):
    - Ensure the AI agent correctly fills the Registered Agent fields, even if names are slightly different.
    - Match agent names using:
      - "California Agent's First Name"
      - "California Agent's Last Name"
      - "Registered Agent Name"
      - "Agent's Name"
      - "Agent Street Address"
      - "Agent Physical Address"
      - "b Street Address (if agent is not a corporation)"
    - Prioritize JSON fields:
      - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name"
      - "RA_Address_Line_1"
      - "registeredAgent.streetAddress"
      - "Registered_Agent.Address"
    - If an agent's name is provided as a full name string, split it into first and last names as needed.
    - If the field is detected but remains empty, force assign the extracted value and log the issue.
    
    DEBUGGING AND VALIDATION:
    - Log any fields that remain unfilled after processing.
    - Ensure the AI agent provides a summary of unmatched fields and suggests corrections.
    - Cross-check all assigned values to confirm they align with expected data.
    
        Contact Information:
        PDF Patterns:
        - "Agent Phone"
        - "Agent Email"
        - "Agent Contact Number"

        JSON Patterns:
        - "RA_Email_Address" (for email)
        - "RA_Contact_No" (for contact number)
        - "agent.contactDetails" (for contact details)

        SPECIAL ATTENTION - FIELD NAME TRUNCATION:
    
    - If no full match is found, use regex-based similarity matching.
    - Ensure prefixes (e.g., "a. ", "b. ") do not cause mismatches.

   PRINCIPAL ADDRESS (MANDATORY FIELD):
    - Ensure "a. Initial Street Address of Principal Office - Do not enter a P.O. Box" is correctly matched.
    - If an exact match is not found, fallback to these:
      - "Initial Street Address of Principal Office"
      - "Principal Office Address"
      - "Business Address"
      
      - "Physical Address"
    - Use fuzzy matching to detect variations of the address field name.
    - If no direct match exists, derive an address from multiple related fields.
    - If the field is detected but remains empty after filling, **force assign the extracted value** and log it for debugging.
        JSON Patterns:
        - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_1" (for Initial Street Address)
        - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Address_Line_2" (for Address Line 2)
        - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_City" (for City)
        - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_State" (for State)
        - "data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Address.PA_Zip_Code" (for Zip Code)
        - If no direct match exists, derive an address from multiple related fields (e.g., general company address fields).

        ORGANIZER INFORMATION:
        Name Fields:
        - "Organizer Name"
        - "Org_Name"
        - "Organizer.Name"
        - "Formation Organizer"

        Contact Details:
        - "Org_Email_Address"
        - "Org_Contact_No"
        - "Organizer Phone"
        - "Organizer Email"
        - Get the FirstName and Last name from the contact details JSON field: "data.contactDetails.firstName" and "data.contactDetails.lastName".

        Signature Fields:
        - "Organizer Signature"
        - "Authorized Signature"
        - "Execution"

        FORM CONTROLS AND BUTTONS:
        - "Box"
        - "Reset1"

# CRITICAL MULTI-SECTION PDF FORM POPULATION PROTOCOL 🚨
# Adaptive Form Population Protocol for Name Fields
# 🚨 CRITICAL STREET ADDRESS POPULATION PROTOCOL

## ABSOLUTE MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET ADDRESS POPULATION
# ENHANCED ADDRESS MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS 🌐

## COMPREHENSIVE ADDRESS POPULATION STRATEGY

### 1. MULTI-FORMAT ADDRESS HANDLING

#### A. MULTI-FIELD ADDRESS POPULATION
- Prioritize separate field mapping when available
- Strictly separate:
  * Street number
  * Street name
  * City
  * State (two-letter abbreviation)
  * ZIP code

#### B. SINGLE-FIELD ADDRESS POPULATION
- When a single "Street Address" field is detected:
  1. CONCATENATE address components in PRECISE order
  2. FORMAT: "Street Number Street Name, City, State ZIP"
  3. EXAMPLE: "123 Business Lane, Springfield, CA 90210"

### 2. POPULATION RULES FOR SINGLE-FIELD SCENARIOS

#### MANDATORY CONCATENATION FORMAT:
- Street Number and Name: ALWAYS FIRST
- City: Separated by comma
- State: Abbreviated, UPPERCASE
- ZIP: Immediately after state
- NO EXTRA SPACES
- USE STANDARD U.S. ADDRESS FORMATTING

### 3. VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS

#### SINGLE-FIELD ADDRESS CHECKS:
- CONFIRM total length fits field constraints
- TRUNCATE if exceeding maximum field length
- PRESERVE critical address components
- PRIORITIZE: Street + City + State + ZIP

### 4. SOURCE PRIORITY FOR ADDRESS EXTRACTION

#### PRIMARY SOURCES:
1. `Registered_Agent.RA_Address.RA_Address_Line1`
2. `Registered_Agent.RA_Address.RA_Address_Line_1`
3. `Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Address.Street`

#### SECONDARY SOURCES:
- `contactDetails.address.streetAddress`
- `businessDetails.primaryAddress`

### 5. SPECIAL HANDLING SCENARIOS

#### EDGE CASES:
- P.O. Box addresses
- Multi-line street addresses
- International address formats

#### RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
- PRIORITIZE most specific, complete address
- VALIDATE against original data source
- CONFIRM semantic accuracy

### 6. CONFIDENCE SCORING

#### ADDRESS MATCHING CONFIDENCE:
- 0.9-1.0: Perfect component match
- 0.7-0.89: Minor formatting adjustments
- 0.5-0.69: Significant reformatting required
- <0.5: REJECT, require manual review

### 7. CRITICAL DIRECTIVES

#### ABSOLUTE RULES:
- ZERO tolerance for address component mixing
- 100% PRECISE field-specific mapping
- SEMANTIC PRESERVATION of address information

### 8. FALLBACK MECHANISM

#### IF STANDARD EXTRACTION FAILS:
1. Attempt partial address reconstruction
2. Flag for manual verification
3. Include reasoning for partial population

### ENFORCEMENT STATEMENT
🚨 COMPREHENSIVE ADDRESS POPULATION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE 🚨
- Every address MUST be populated with MAXIMUM precision
- NO address left incomplete or improperly formatted


### 1. PRIMARY ADDRESS EXTRACTION SOURCE
- FULL STREET ADDRESS: 
  * Primary Source: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Principal_Business_Address.Address_Line_1`
  * FALLBACK Source: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Business_Address.Street_Address`

### 2. STRICT POPULATION RULES
- COMPLETELY FILL the ENTIRE street address line
- ZERO TOLERANCE for partial or incomplete addresses
- REJECT any submission with truncated or incomplete address

### 3. VALIDATION CRITERIA
- MUST INCLUDE:
  * Complete street number
  * Full street name
  * Street type (Street, Avenue, Boulevard, etc.)
  * NO ABBREVIATIONS UNLESS EXPLICITLY IN SOURCE DATA

### 4. CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- NEVER USE P.O. BOXES (EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN)
- MATCH EXACTLY with source address
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMATTING
- NO MODIFICATIONS TO ADDRESS STRUCTURE

### 5. COMPREHENSIVE ADDRESS VERIFICATION
- CROSS-REFERENCE with multiple data sources
- VERIFY AGAINST:
  * Business Registration Data
  * Entity Formation Payload
  * Contact Information Sources

### 6. ERROR PREVENTION MECHANISMS
- IF address is missing or incomplete:
  * TRIGGER IMMEDIATE POPULATION ERROR
  * DO NOT AUTO-GENERATE OR GUESS
  * REQUIRE MANUAL REVIEW

### 7. FORMATTING GUIDELINES
- MAINTAIN ORIGINAL CAPITALIZATION
- PRESERVE FULL ADDRESS COMPONENTS
- ENSURE READABILITY AND PRECISION

### 8. MULTI-SOURCE ADDRESS VERIFICATION
```
FUNCTION verify_street_address(address_sources):
    PRIORITY_SOURCES = [
        'Principal_Business_Address.Address_Line_1',
        'Business_Address.Street_Address',
        'Contact_Information.Street_Address'
    ]
    
    FOR source IN PRIORITY_SOURCES:
        IF address IS VALID and COMPLETE:
            RETURN address
    
    TRIGGER POPULATION_ERROR
```

### 9. ABSOLUTE REJECTION CRITERIA
- P.O. Box addresses
- Incomplete street addresses
- Addresses with missing critical components
- Addresses from non-primary sources without verification

### 10. FINAL VERIFICATION STATEMENT
✅ CONFIRM: Full street address populated
✅ VERIFY: No P.O. Box used
✅ VALIDATE: Address matches source data exactly

## ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE
ZERO TOLERANCE for incomplete or incorrect street address population. EVERY character MUST be precisely and completely populated following these STRICT guidelines.

## Core Population Strategy

### 


if the pdf field asks for effective date of filing then put in current date (strictly critical)

### 3. Validation Checks
- Verify name population meets 85% confidence threshold
- Confirm no data truncation
- Ensure semantic accuracy

### 4. Special Handling Scenarios
- Professional/Academic Titles
- Name Suffixes (Jr., Sr., III)
- Hyphenated Names
- Names with Apostrophes or Special Characters

## CRITICAL FONT AND LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. GENERAL LAYOUT PRINCIPLES
- MAINTAIN EXACT VISUAL ALIGNMENT WITH ORIGINAL DOCUMENT
- PRESERVE ORIGINAL FIELD SPACING
- MATCH ORIGINAL DOCUMENT'S MARGINS AND FIELD DIMENSIONS

### 2. FONT SIZE ADAPTATION RULES
- ANALYZE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT'S FONT SIZES
- DYNAMICALLY ADJUST TEXT TO FIT DESIGNATED FIELD SPACES
- SCALING ALGORITHM:
  * IF text exceeds field width: REDUCE font size
  * IF text is too small: INCREASE font size SLIGHTLY
  * MINIMUM READABLE FONT SIZE: 8pt
  * MAXIMUM FONT SIZE: Match original document's primary font size

### 3. FIELD-SPECIFIC FONT HANDLING
- HEADING FIELDS: 
  * BOLD TYPOGRAPHY
  * 1-2 POINTS LARGER THAN BODY TEXT
- STANDARD ENTRY FIELDS:
  * CONSISTENT FONT FAMILY
  * UNIFORM FONT WEIGHT
- SIGNATURE FIELDS:
  * SLIGHT VARIATION IN FONT (MORE NATURAL APPEARANCE)
  * MAINTAIN LEGIBILITY

### 4. ADAPTIVE TEXT FITTING STRATEGY
```
FUNCTION adjust_text_to_field(text, field_width, original_font_size):
    WHILE text_width > field_width:
        REDUCE font_size
        RECALCULATE text_width
    
    IF font_size < MINIMUM_READABLE_SIZE:
        TRIGGER MANUAL REVIEW FLAG
    
    RETURN adjusted_text_with_font_size
```

### 5. ERROR PREVENTION MECHANISMS
- PREVENT TEXT OVERFLOW
- MAINTAIN READABILITY
- PRESERVE DOCUMENT AESTHETIC
- ENSURE CONSISTENT VISUAL WEIGHT

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

1. TEXT SCALING PRIORITY:
   - READABILITY
   - FIELD BOUNDARY PRESERVATION
   - AESTHETIC CONSISTENCY

2. FONT SELECTION HIERARCHY:
   - MATCH ORIGINAL DOCUMENT FONT
   - USE PROFESSIONAL, CLEAR TYPEFACES
   - PRIORITY: SANS-SERIF FOR CLARITY

3. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - HANDLE MULTI-LINE ENTRIES
   - ADJUST LINE HEIGHT
   - MAINTAIN VERTICAL CENTERING

### TECHNICAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- ✅ Field boundary respected
- ✅ Text fully visible
- ✅ Font size within 8-12pt range
- ✅ Consistent typography
- ✅ No text truncation
- ✅ Maintains original document's visual integrity

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTES
- ABSOLUTE PRECISION IN LAYOUT REPRODUCTION
- NO DEVIATION FROM ORIGINAL DOCUMENT'S VISUAL STRUCTURE
- HUMAN-LIKE ATTENTION TO TYPOGRAPHIC DETAIL


### ### ### 2. Entity Name Fields (EXTREME PRIORITY ALERT - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY):

**🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE ALERT: ENTITY NAME POPULATION 🚨**
**🚨 ALL PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVE FAILED - THIS IS A SEVERE ISSUE 🚨**

**THE PROBLEM:**
- The agent is CONSISTENTLY FAILING to populate entity name in multiple required locations
- The agent is only filling ONE entity name field when multiple fields require identical population
- This is causing COMPLETE FORM REJECTION by government agencies

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **IDENTIFY ALL ENTITY NAME FIELDS:**
   - - Search the ENTIRE document for ANY field that could hold an entity name
   - This includes fields labeled: Entity Name, LLC Name, Company Name, Corporation Name, Business Name
   - This includes ANY field in registration sections, certification sections, or signature blocks requiring the entity name
   - This includes ANY field in article sections requiring entity name
   - COUNT THESE FIELDS and list them by UUID

2. **POPULATION PROCEDURE - EXTREME ATTENTION REQUIRED:**
   - COPY THE EXACT SAME entity name to EVERY identified field
   - DO NOT SKIP ANY entity name field for ANY reason
   - After populating, CHECK EACH FIELD again to verify population
   - VERIFY THE COUNT matches your initial entity name field count

3. **CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS - MUST PERFORM:**
   - After initial population, SCAN THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT AGAIN
   - Look for ANY unpopulated field that might need the entity name
   - If found, ADD TO YOUR LIST and populate immediately
   - Double-check ALL headers, footers, and marginalia for entity name fields
   - Triple-check signature blocks, certification statements for entity name fields

4. **NO EXCEPTIONS PERMITTED:**
   - If you only populated ONE entity name field, YOU HAVE FAILED this task
   - You MUST populate EVERY instance where the entity name is required
   - MINIMUM acceptable count of populated entity name fields is 2 or more

5. **FINAL VERIFICATION STATEMENT REQUIRED:**
   - You MUST include: "I have populated the entity name in X different locations (UUIDs: list them all)"
   - You MUST include: "I have verified NO entity name fields were missed"
   - You MUST include: "All entity name fields contain exactly the same value"

**EXTRACTION SOURCE (ENTITY NAME):**
- For LLCs: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.LLC_Name`
- For Corporations: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Corporation_Name` or `Corp_Name`
- Generic path: `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Entity_Name`

**FINAL WARNING:**
- This is the MOST CRITICAL part of form population
- Government agencies REJECT forms with inconsistent entity names
- Multiple instances of the entity name MUST match exactly
- No exceptions, no exclusions, no oversights permitted

* **FINAL VERIFICATION:**
  - In your reasoning, explicitly state: "I have verified that ALL entity name fields (total count: X) have been populated with the identical value"
### 3. Registered Agent Information (Critical):
* This section is of utmost importance. Handle with extreme care.
    * If the registered agent is an entity, select the checkbox or tick the checkbox compulsorily (STRICTLY EXTREMELY CRITICAL).
* Determine the agent type (individual or entity) by examining `data.orderDetails.strapiOrderFormJson.Payload.Entity_Formation.Registered_Agent.RA_Name`.
* Individual agents have first and last names without corporate identifiers.
* Entity/commercial agents contain identifiers like "Inc," "LLC," "Corp," "Company."
* For individuals, use `RA_Name` for "Individual Registered Agent," "Registered Agent Name," "Natural Person," etc.
* Fill individual agent checkboxes or radio buttons.
* For entities/commercial agents, use `RA_Name` for "Commercial Registered Agent," "Entity Registered Agent," "Name of Registered Agent Company," etc.
* Fill commercial/entity agent checkboxes or radio buttons.
* Correctly identify and fill address fields. Do not fill addresses into the agent's name field.
* Use `RA_Name` ONLY for the registered agent's name.
*### ### ADDRESS MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: Implement ABSOLUTE PRECISION in address field mapping

1. ADDRESS COMPONENT SEPARATION:
   - MANDATORY: Separate street, city, state, ZIP into DISTINCT fields
   - NEVER insert full address into a single field
   - STRICTLY map each component to its dedicated field

2. FIELD-SPECIFIC MAPPING RULES:
   - STREET ADDRESS add complete principal address here in case of street address and store it : 
     * Numeric street number + street name
     * NO city, state, ZIP
   
   - CITY: 
     * City name ONLY
     * NO additional descriptors
   
   - STATE: 
     * TWO-LETTER ABBREVIATION
     * Uppercase (e.g., "CA", "NY")
   
   - ZIP CODE:
     * 5-digit format
     * Optional 4-digit extension

3. VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS:
   - REJECT any match that:
     * Mixes address components
     * Inserts address in name fields
     * Provides incomplete or incorrect segments

 

ABSOLUTE RULE: 
- ZERO TOLERANCE for address component mixing
- 100% PRECISE, FIELD-SPECIFIC MAPPING

2. REGISTERED AGENT NAME HANDLING:
   - Use `RA_Name` EXCLUSIVELY for the agent's name field
   - DISTINGUISH between individual and commercial agents:
     * Individual Agent: First and Last Name ONLY
    
4. CHECKBOX/RADIO BUTTON SELECTION:
   - MANDATORY: Select appropriate agent type checkbox
     * Individual Registered Agent checkbox
     * Commercial/Entity Registered Agent checkbox

5. STRICT VALIDATION CRITERIA:
   - REJECT matches that:
     * Place address in name fields
     * Mix address components
     * Fail to distinguish agent type
     * Omit required type selection

CRITICAL EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:



- Individual: "John Smith" → Individual Registered Agent
- Commercial/Business/Entity : "Tech Solutions LLC" → Commercial Registered Agent /Business R

      ### **Highly Accurate AI Agent for LLC Registration Automation** 

      #### **Execution Guidelines:**
      - In case of the error "Site cannot be reached," reload the page.
      - Accurately detect and interact with all required form fields dynamically.
      - Ensure precise population of values from `jsonData`, verifying each entry before submission.
      - Adapt to different state-specific form layouts, handling field variations seamlessly.
      - Implement intelligent wait times and fallback strategies if elements are not immediately detected.
      - Manage multi-step forms efficiently, tracking progress and resuming from failures.

      #### **Handling Buttons and Interactive Elements:**
      - Identify and click buttons labeled "Start Filing," "Begin Filing," or "Start Register Business."
      - Ensure the button is visible and enabled before clicking.
      - Use image recognition if buttons are non-standard or embedded as images.
      -Properly click the "Start Filing" button and wait until the button is clicked try until the button is detected. 
      - XPath detection strategy: `//a[contains(., 'Start Filing')] | //button[contains(., 'Start Filing')]`.
      - **Ensure visibility before clicking:** Scroll the element into view before clicking.
      - **Retry clicking up to 3 times** if the button does not respond.
      - **Alternative click methods:**
        - If standard clicking fails, use JavaScript execution:
        ```js
        arguments[0].click();
        ```
        - If interception issues occur, use:
        ```js
        document.querySelector('button_selector').click();
        ```
      - **Error Handling:** If the click fails after retries, log the issue and attempt a page refresh before retrying.
      - Click on "Start Online Filing" or a relevant button by intelligently detecting it and retrying until successful.

      #### **Error Handling & Page Recovery:**
      - If a `400` error occurs, reload the page and continue from the last completed step.
      - Implement automatic retries for failed interactions and dynamically adjust timeouts.
      - Log errors with contextual information to facilitate debugging.

      ### **Task Execution Steps**

      - Choose "File Online" if given the option.
      - Click "Save Name" or "Proceed" as required.

      #### **4. Form Completion with Accurate Data Entry**
      - Dynamically identify and populate all mandatory fields using `${jsonData["jsonData"]["Payload"]}`.
      - **Implement fallback mechanisms:** If a field is not detected, retry and attempt to find alternative identifiers.
      - Validate each input field to ensure correctness before proceeding.
      - Log missing or problematic fields for debugging.
      - Ignore optional fields unless explicitly necessary.

      #### **5. Registered Agent Information**

      - Detect and select if the registered agent is an individual or business entity.
      - Split and input first and last names where applicable.
      - Fill address fields including street, city, state, ZIP, and county.
      - If the form asks whether the "Registered Agent Mailing Address" is the same as the "Registered Agent Address," select "Yes."
      - Ensure fields are accurately detected and values properly entered before proceeding.

      #### **6. Principal Office Address**
      - Accurately fill out address fields:
        - Street: `${jsonData["jsonData"]["Payload"]["Entity_Formation"]["Principal_Address"]["PA_Address_Line_1"]}`.
        - City: `${jsonData["jsonData"]["Payload"]["Entity_Formation"]["Principal_Address"]["PA_City"]}`.
        - State: `${jsonData["jsonData"]["Payload"]["Entity_Formation"]["Principal_Address"]["PA_State"]}`.
        - ZIP Code: `${jsonData["jsonData"]["Payload"]["Entity_Formation"]["Principal_Address"]["PA_Zip_Code"]}`.
