Generated Questions:
1. [React Fundamentals] Explain the difference between `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in React.  Provide examples of when you'd use each.
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate a clear understanding of the purpose and usage of both hooks.  The examples should be relevant and showcase practical application.  Look for an explanation of the dependency array in `useEffect`.
   Model Answer: `useState` is a hook that allows functional components to manage state. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state value and a function to update it.  For example, to manage the count of items in a shopping cart, I'd use `useState(0)`.  The returned value would be the current count, and the function would increment or decrement it whenever an item is added or removed.

`useEffect` is a hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components.  Side effects include things like data fetching, manipulating the DOM directly, or setting timers.  It takes a function as an argument that will be executed after every render.  Crucially, it also accepts an optional dependency array.  If the dependency array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once after the initial render, similar to `componentDidMount`. If the dependency array includes variables, the effect runs whenever those variables change.  For instance, to fetch data from an API when a specific ID changes, I'd use `useEffect(() => {fetchData(id)}, [id])`.  This ensures that the data fetches only when the `id` changes, preventing unnecessary requests.

2. [React State Management] Describe your experience with Redux.  What are its benefits and drawbacks compared to using only React's built-in state management?
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate practical experience with Redux, including understanding of its core concepts (store, actions, reducers).  They should be able to articulate the trade-offs between Redux and simpler state management approaches.
   Model Answer: I've used Redux extensively in several projects to manage complex application state.  It's particularly beneficial when dealing with large amounts of data that need to be shared across multiple components.  Redux provides a predictable and centralized way to manage state, making it easier to debug and test.  The unidirectional data flow ensures that state updates are tracked and easily understood.

However, Redux can introduce boilerplate code and complexity, especially in smaller applications.  Setting up the store, actions, and reducers can be time-consuming.  For simpler applications, React's built-in state management with `useState` and `useContext` might be sufficient and less cumbersome.  The choice depends on the project's scale and complexity; for large, complex applications, the structure and predictability of Redux outweighs the added complexity.

3. [Component Design & Optimization] Explain how you would optimize a React component for performance, particularly when dealing with a large list of items.
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of techniques like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and virtualized lists.
   Model Answer: Optimizing a React component rendering a large list involves several strategies.  First, I'd use `React.memo` to prevent re-renders if the props haven't changed.  This is a simple and effective way to optimize components that receive many props.  Second, if computationally expensive calculations are involved, I'd use `useMemo` to memoize the results and avoid recalculating them on every render.  Similarly, `useCallback` can memoize callback functions, preventing unnecessary recreations.  For very large lists, I'd consider using a virtualized list library like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.  These libraries only render the items currently visible on the screen, drastically improving performance.  Finally, I'd profile the component using React's profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and target optimization efforts effectively.

4. [API Interaction & Data Handling] Describe your experience working with RESTful APIs in a React application. How do you handle asynchronous operations and potential errors?
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of fetching data using `fetch` or `axios`, handling promises, and error management.
   Model Answer: I typically use `fetch` or `axios` to interact with RESTful APIs in my React applications.  These libraries handle asynchronous requests effectively.  To handle asynchronous operations, I use `async/await` to make the code more readable and easier to manage.  For example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    //Process data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    //Handle error, e.g., display an error message to the user.
  }
}
```

This approach allows me to gracefully handle network errors and other potential issues.  I always include comprehensive error handling to provide informative feedback to the user and prevent unexpected crashes.

5. [Testing] How would you write unit tests for a React component using Jest and Enzyme (or a similar testing framework)?  Give an example.
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate familiarity with testing frameworks and best practices.  The example should be clear and illustrate the testing process.
   Model Answer: I'd use Jest for unit testing and Enzyme for rendering and interacting with React components.  The approach involves rendering the component, simulating user interactions (like clicks or input changes), and asserting that the component behaves correctly.

For example, let's say I have a simple button component that increments a counter:

```javascript
// Button.js
import React, {useState} from 'react';

function Button() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Button;

// Button.test.js
import React from 'react';
import {render, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('button increments counter on click', () => {
  const {getByText, queryByText} = render(<Button />);
  const button = getByText('Increment');
  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(getByText('Count: 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(queryByText('Count: 0')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This test renders the component, finds the button, simulates a click, and then asserts that the count has been incremented.  I'd write similar tests for various scenarios and edge cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

6. [Git & Version Control] Describe your workflow using Git, including branching strategies and how you handle merge conflicts.
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of common Git commands and best practices for collaborative development.
   Model Answer: My typical Git workflow involves using a feature branch for each new feature or bug fix.  I create a branch from the `develop` or `main` branch (depending on the project's branching strategy), make my changes, commit them with clear and concise messages, and then create a pull request to merge the changes back into the main branch.

Before merging, I thoroughly review my code and ensure it meets the project's quality standards.  If merge conflicts occur, I resolve them carefully, comparing the changes in the different branches and selecting the correct version of the code. I prefer to resolve conflicts manually, ensuring that the changes are correct and well-integrated.   I use tools provided by Git or my IDE to visualize the conflicts and make the necessary adjustments. After resolving the conflict, I commit the changes and push the updated branch for review and merge.

7. [Agile Development] Describe your experience working in an Agile environment.  What are some of the Agile methodologies you are familiar with, and how have you contributed to successful Agile projects?
   Evaluation Criteria: The candidate should demonstrate a practical understanding of Agile principles and their application in a development setting.
   Model Answer: I have extensive experience working in Agile environments, primarily using Scrum and Kanban methodologies.  In Scrum projects, I participate actively in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.  I contribute to defining user stories and breaking down tasks into manageable units of work.  My focus is on delivering high-quality code within the sprint timeframe.  In Kanban projects, I focus on visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, and continuously improving the process.  I use tools like Jira to track progress, manage tasks, and communicate effectively with the team.  My contributions to successful Agile projects include consistently meeting sprint goals, proactively identifying and resolving issues, and actively participating in team discussions to improve our processes and deliverables.  I am always looking for ways to optimize our workflow and enhance collaboration.
