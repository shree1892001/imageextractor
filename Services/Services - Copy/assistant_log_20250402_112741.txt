Generated Questions:
1. [Technical] Describe your experience with both Django and Flask.  What are the key differences between them, and when would you choose one over the other for a project?
   Evaluation: A good answer will demonstrate a solid understanding of both frameworks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  It should include specific examples of projects where one framework was preferred over the other and why, showcasing practical application of this knowledge.  Expect mention of architectural differences (e.g., Django's batteries-included approach vs. Flask's flexibility), scaling considerations, and project requirements influencing the choice.

2. [Technical] Explain your experience with SQL and NoSQL databases.  Give an example where you chose one over the other and justify your decision.
   Evaluation: The candidate should be able to articulate the differences between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.  A strong answer will include specific examples detailing the data model, scalability needs, and query patterns that led to the selection of a particular database type.  They should demonstrate understanding of data consistency, performance trade-offs, and appropriate use cases for each type.

3. [Technical] Walk me through your process for debugging a complex Python application.  What tools and techniques do you employ?
   Evaluation: The candidate should describe a systematic approach to debugging.  This might involve using print statements, debuggers (like pdb), logging, unit testing, and using code analysis tools.  A good answer will highlight their problem-solving skills and ability to efficiently identify and resolve issues.  Mentioning specific scenarios and the effectiveness of different debugging strategies would strengthen the response.

4. [Behavioral] Tell me about a time you had to work on a project with tight deadlines and limited resources. How did you manage your time and priorities?
   Evaluation: The answer should demonstrate effective time management, prioritization skills, and problem-solving under pressure.  The candidate should describe specific strategies used to meet deadlines, including delegation (if applicable), identifying critical tasks, and efficient resource allocation.  The focus is on the process and the outcome, showcasing resilience and adaptability.

5. [Behavioral] Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a team member who had a different approach to solving a problem than you did. How did you resolve the conflict?
   Evaluation: This question assesses teamwork and conflict-resolution skills.  The ideal answer will showcase effective communication, compromise, and a willingness to consider alternative perspectives.  The candidate should demonstrate an ability to find common ground, value diverse viewpoints, and reach a mutually beneficial solution.

6. [Situational] Imagine you're working on a web application using Flask, and you're experiencing significant performance issues.  How would you approach diagnosing and resolving this problem?
   Evaluation: The candidate should outline a structured approach to troubleshooting performance issues.  This might include profiling the application to identify bottlenecks, using performance monitoring tools, optimizing database queries, caching strategies, and code optimization techniques.  A strong answer will demonstrate a systematic approach and a practical understanding of performance optimization in a web application context.

7. [Situational] You discover a bug in production that's causing a critical issue. Describe your steps in addressing this situation.
   Evaluation: The ideal answer will demonstrate a methodical approach to handling production issues.  This includes prioritizing the severity, identifying the root cause, implementing a temporary fix (if necessary), and then a permanent solution.  The response should also address communication to stakeholders and post-incident analysis to prevent similar issues.

8. [Behavioral] Describe a time you had to learn a new technology or programming language quickly.  How did you approach the learning process?
   Evaluation: This question assesses the candidate's ability to learn independently and adapt to new challenges. The candidate should describe their learning methods (e.g., online courses, documentation, experimentation), highlighting their proactive approach and resourcefulness.  The focus is on the process, demonstrating self-motivation and a commitment to continuous learning.
