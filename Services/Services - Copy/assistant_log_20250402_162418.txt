Generated Questions:
1. [Technical] Describe your experience with React's state management solutions, such as Redux or Context API.  Which have you used, and why did you choose those solutions for specific projects?
   Evaluation: Look for a clear understanding of the differences between Redux and Context API, including their strengths and weaknesses.  A good answer will demonstrate experience choosing the right tool for the job based on project complexity and scale, and explain their reasoning for the choice in past projects.  Examples of successful implementations are a plus.

2. [Technical] Explain your approach to optimizing the performance of a React application. What techniques do you use to identify and address performance bottlenecks?
   Evaluation: The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, and virtualized lists.  A strong answer will go beyond simply listing techniques and explain how they've applied these in real-world scenarios, quantifying the improvements achieved.

3. [Technical] Walk me through your process for testing a React component. What testing frameworks are you familiar with, and how do you ensure good test coverage?
   Evaluation: Look for familiarity with testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Enzyme). A good answer will describe a structured testing approach (unit, integration, potentially end-to-end), including the types of tests they write and how they ensure adequate coverage.  Mention of mocking and testing asynchronous operations is a plus.

4. [Behavioral] Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult or conflicting design. How did you navigate the situation to arrive at a satisfactory solution?
   Evaluation: Assess the candidate's communication and problem-solving skills.  A strong answer will demonstrate active listening, collaboration, compromise, and the ability to find solutions that meet both technical and design requirements.

5. [Behavioral] Tell me about a time you had to debug a complex issue in a React application.  What steps did you take to identify and resolve the problem?
   Evaluation: This evaluates problem-solving and debugging skills.  A good answer will detail a systematic approach to debugging, including using developer tools, logging, and potentially stepping through code.  It should highlight their ability to isolate the problem and effectively resolve it.

6. [Situational] Imagine you're working on a large React application, and a new feature requires significant changes to the existing codebase. How would you approach this task to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth integration?
   Evaluation: Assess their understanding of software development best practices, such as version control, code reviews, and modular design.  A good answer will emphasize planning, incremental development, thorough testing, and collaboration with the team to minimize risk.

7. [Situational] Let's say you discover a critical bug in production after a deployment.  Describe your process for handling this situation.
   Evaluation: This assesses their ability to handle pressure and critical situations. A strong answer will demonstrate a calm and methodical approach, including steps like identifying the root cause, implementing a hotfix, and preventing future occurrences.  Communication with stakeholders is also key.

8. [Technical] Explain your understanding of the differences between functional and class components in React.  When would you choose one over the other?
   Evaluation: Assess their understanding of React's component model.  A good answer will accurately describe the differences and explain the benefits of functional components (hooks, cleaner syntax) and situations where class components might still be preferred (complex lifecycle methods).

9. [Technical] Describe your experience with any state management libraries beyond Redux (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, Recoil).  What are their relative strengths and weaknesses compared to Redux?
   Evaluation: This question targets candidates with more advanced knowledge.  A good answer demonstrates familiarity with at least one alternative state management library and can articulate comparative advantages in terms of performance, complexity, and ease of use relative to Redux.  If they haven't used any alternatives, they should explain why and what they've researched.
