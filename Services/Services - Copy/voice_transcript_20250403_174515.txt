Choose a Corporate Name: Availability: Your chosen name must be distinguishable from other Alabama corporations. Check availability through the Alabama Secretary of State s website. The name must include the word Corporation, Incorporated, Inc., or Corp. Registered Agent: You ll need to designate a registered agent a person or business entity in Alabama who will receive legal and official documents on behalf of the corporation.

There s a filing fee. You can find the current fee schedule on their website. Processing: The Secretary of State will review your filing. Once approved, you ll receive a Certificate of Incorporation. 3. Create Corporate Bylaws: Purpose: Bylaws are internal rules governing the corporation s operations. They outline how the corporation will be managed, including the roles of directors and officers, shareholder meetings, and other internal matters. While not required to be filed with the state, they are crucial for the internal governance of your corporation. 4. Hold an Organizational Meeting: Purpose: This meeting is where the initial directors are elected (if not named in the Articles of Incorporation), officers are appointed, and the corporation s initial business is conducted. Minutes of this meeting should be kept. 5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN): Purpose: If your corporation will have employees or operate a bank account, you ll need an EIN from the IRS. This is a federal tax identification number. You can apply for an EIN online through the IRS website. 6. Comply with Ongoing Requirements: Annual Reports: Alabama requires corporations to file an annual report with the Secretary of State. This typically involves updating information about the corporation and paying a fee. Taxes: Your corporation will be subject to various state and federal taxes, including income tax, franchise tax (depending on your structure and revenue), and potentially sales tax. Where to Find More Information and File: The most reliable source of information is the Alabama Secretary of State s website . Their website provides detailed instructions, forms, and fee schedules. You should check their website for the most up-to-date information, as rules and fees can change. Consider Professional Help: While you can form a corporation yourself, it s often advisable to seek professional assistance from a lawyer or registered agent service. They can ensure your corporation is properly formed and compliant with all legal requirements, saving you potential headaches in the future. This is especially true if your corporation will have complex structures or significant assets.

This internal document outlines the LLC s operating procedures, member responsibilities, profit and loss sharing, and other important details. It helps avoid future disputes among members.
